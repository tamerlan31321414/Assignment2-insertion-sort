# Assignment2-insertion-sort

## Overview
This project is part of **Assignment 2** for Algorithmic Analysis.  
It implements **Insertion Sort** with performance tracking, unit tests, and benchmarking.  

The main goals are:
Implement and analyze the **Insertion Sort** algorithm
Apply **asymptotic complexity analysis** (O, Θ, Ω)
Collect **performance metrics** (comparisons, shifts, array accesses, execution time)
Run **benchmarks** for different input sizes
Validate theoretical analysis with **empirical results
